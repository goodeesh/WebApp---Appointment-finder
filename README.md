# WebApp---Appointment-finder

Small single page Web App to practice the skills learned at the web scripting subject. It is based on a database where everything is stored.
Afterwards the content of the page will be loaded with ajax calls to the API. Using javascript with some Jquery the whole features of the web
app will come to live. A fun little project to make sure all the contents of the subject were understood and correctly applied.
